(! means necessary / blocker for releasing v3)

# Library code:
! Finalize tag and prime function interface
    ! Add tests for tag and prime functions on ITensor, MPS, MPO
o Add alternative to niter which starts at 1. Solver iterations? Eigen iterations?
  --> Matt: see https://github.com/ITensor/ITensor/issues/209
o Remove support for zipUpApplyMPO, exactApplyMPO, fitApplyMPO

# Github:
! Update branch names on Github (rc3 -> v3)

# Website:
! Update website:
  o Detailed documentation
    - See Github issue list
    - info about QN blocks in Index objects
    X how to make QN ITensors
    - removeQNs ITensor function
    - removeQNs MPS function
  o List of deprecrations/guide to update code
  o ITensor book
    - Update TRG to show use of Tags
    - TRG code (book/trg.cc)
  o Tutorials
  o Code formulas


# Final Release Checks
  ! Fresh install with new options.mk file compiles
  ! Jenkins is passing
  ! All sample codes compile and run and are up to date
  ? Incorporate sample codes into Jenkins/testing 
    (I found the DMRG codes were useful for catching bugs, 
     and TRG is a good test case for Tags)
    Miles say: Yes I agree. We could put copies of the sample codes
    or crucial sections of the sample codes into the unit
    tests. Maybe for the DMRG one just do one sweep.
    Or perhaps better, Dylan can config Jenkins to 
    compile the sample codes.

Completed (this is to help keep track of changes made, but we should make an official
           list for the website):

Common operation deprecations (for upgrade guide):
 - Index operations:
  o Removed `mapPrime(1,2,...)`, use `replaceTags("1","2",...)` instead
    -> `mapPrime(1,2,"0")` doesn't make sense, many uses of `mapPrime` are superseded
        by `replaceInds`, `replaceTags`, `setPrime`, etc.
  o Prime level can be accessed through TagSet, i.e. `findIndex(A,"Site,1")` means Index with
    tag "Site" and prime level 1
  o `sim(Index)` now by default keeps the prime level of the Index instead of setting to zero
  o `Index.dir(Arrow)` -> `Index.setDir(Arrow)`
  o Added `dir(Index)` as preferred alternative to `Index.dir()`
  o Changed index constructor from `Index("i",2)` -> `Index(2,"i")` (deprecation error)
  o noprime -> noPrime (deprecation error)
  o Added `dim(Index)` as preferred alternative to `Index.m()`, changed throughout library (deprecation warning?)
  o Removed `findIndex(IndexSet const& iset, Arrow dir)`
  o Added `id(Index)` as preferred alternative to `Index.id()`
  o Remove IQTensor and IQIndex types, merging with ITensor and Index (also
    removed IQIndexVal, IQMPS, IQMPO, etc)
  o Add findIndex(ITensor,TagSet) -> Index, which finds the Index in the ITensor 
    containing certain tags
  o Remove findType, use findIndex instead
 - ITensor operations:
  o Added `uniqueIndex(A,{B,C}[,ts])` notation for getting the unique index under
    a certain tag constraint
  o Allow tag and prime functions to accept multiple indices for matching
    o Also allow IndexSet for matching
  o Add `inds(ITensor)` as preferred alternative to `ITensor.inds()`
  o Add `index(ITensor,int)` as preferred alternative to `ITensor.index(int)`
  o New QN design:
    Store a smallstring along with QN value and mod fac. Storage is an array (fixed-size)
    of triples name-val-modfac.
  o `order(A,i,j,k)` -> `permute(A,i,j,k)` to permute the date of an ITensor
  o Removed `permute(A,i,"...")` syntax
  o Add deprecation warning for prime(ITensor,Index,int) pointing towards prime(ITensor,int,Index)
  o Renamed ITensor .real and .cplx to .elt and .eltC; kept .real and .cplx just for
    backwards compatibility. Replaced throughout library.
  o Replace maxM(IndexSet) and minM(IndexSet) with maxDim(IndexSet) and minDim(IndexSet)
  o Deprecate "Maxm", "Minm" args in favor of "MaxDim", "MinDim" in svd(), diagHermitian(), factorize(), dmrg(), idmrg(), etc.
    -> Added error in all functions that use "Maxm" and "Minm", saying to use "MaxDim" and "MinDim"
  o Deprecate randomize(ITensor& T) in favor of T.randomize()
  o Remove IQTensor and IQIndex types, merging with ITensor and Index (also
    removed IQIndexVal, IQMPS, IQMPO, etc)
  o Deprecate reindex(ITensor,Index,Index,...), replace with replaceInds(ITensor,Index,Index,...)
    that does not ignore prime levels and internally calls delta() (deprecation error)
  o Deprecate randomTensor, matrixTensor, diagTensor in favor of randomITensor, matrixITensor, diagITensor (deprecation warnings)
  o Added .elt and .eltC accepting vector<int> (pull #194)
  o Added .elt(vector<IndexVal>), .eltC(vector<IndexVal>), etc.
  o Test removeQNs is working correctly for QDiag -> Diag case. Remove the toDense function.
  o Change name of findIndex(ITensor,Index) -> int to indexPosition(ITensor,Index) -> int
 - MPS operations:
  o Added `addTags(MPS,...)`, `replaceTags(MPS,...)`, `prime(MPS,...)`, etc.
  o Add `linkIndex(MPS,int)` and `siteIndex(MPS,int)` to get link and site indices
  o Add `sites(MPS)` as alterative to `MPS.sites()` to get SiteSet
  o Deprecate `MPO.primeall()` in favor of `MPO.prime()`
  o psi.A(i) -> psi(i), psi.Aref(i) -> psi.ref(i), psi.setA(i,T) -> psi.set(i,T) (no warning or error)
  o psi.N() -> length(psi)
  o Replace maxM(MPS) and averageM(MPS) with maxLinkDim(MPS) and averageLinkDim(MPS)
  o Deprecate "Maxm", "Minm" args in favor of "MaxDim", "MinDim" in svd(), diagHermitian(), factorize(), dmrg(), idmrg(), etc.
    -> Added error in all functions that use "Maxm" and "Minm", saying to use "MaxDim" and "MinDim"
  o Deprecate normalize(MPS& psi) in favor of psi.normalize()
  o Better tag convention for labelling site index (i.e. "n=1" instead of "1" for site 1)
    o Site and Link IndexTypes removed in favor of tags
    o Make sure that "Link" index keeps a consistent convention for labelling which link
      (i.e. MPS at site "n=4" should have left link with tags "Link,l=3" and right link with
       tags "Link,l=4")
  o All site sets except SiteSet(N,d) default to ConserveQNs=true
  o Test that new QN system allows mixing different site types
    (--> add MixedSiteSet to docs)
  o Change default behavior of MPS(sites,m) constructor to be uninitialized MPS of size m
    o m>1 only allowed with no QNs
  o Add randomMPS(SiteSet,m=1) function with no QNs
  o Add randomMPS(InitState) function for QNs and no QNs
  o Remove dependency of itensor/mps/localop.h in itensor/decomp.h (this seemed to be the only itensor/mps/ dependency left in itensor/)
 - MPO operations:
  o Add `linkIndex(MPO,int)` and `siteIndex(MPO,int[,TagSet])` to get link and site indices
    -> Since there are two site indices, one can use a TagSet like "0" or "1" to decide which site index to grab
  o primeall(MPO) -> prime(MPO)
  o Restore conversion of AutoMPO to MPO (allowing code like MPO(ampo)).
   o Add deprecation warning to MPO(AutoMPO), telling people to switch
     to toMPO(AutoMPO)
  o Added errMPOProd and deprecated checkMPOProd
 - DMRG operations:
  o Deprecate "Maxm", "Minm" args in favor of "MaxDim", "MinDim" in svd(), diagHermitian(), factorize(), dmrg(), idmrg(), etc.
    -> Added error in all functions that use "Maxm" and "Minm", saying to use "MaxDim" and "MinDim"
  o In Sweeps object, changed from .maxm() and .minm() to .maxdim() and .mindim(), is there a good way to deprecate?

Recent commits to v2 (master branch):
  o errMPOProd and deprecation of checkMPOProd
  o More combiner constructors (combiner(IndexSet), combiner(initializer_list), etc.)
  o Bugfix for nmultMPO
  o More combiner constructors (combiner(IndexSet), combiner(initializer_list), etc.)

-----------------------------------------------

Optional (possibly post V3, because not breaking changes):
 --> TODO: add these as issues on Github
o Remove "Link" and "Site" from MPS and MPO functions
  -> Instead use uniqueIndex, commonIndex, siteIndex, linkIndex, etc.
  o DMRG, applyMPO, etc.
o Implement randomMPS(InitState,m>1)
  o Make initial MPS from initstate, then apply a random unitary circuit
o Define QDense * Dense contraction directly
o Make modifying functions member functions and all other functions free
  (at least for externally-facing functions)
o Add MPS(std::vector<ITensor>) constructor
o Generalize the convention for diagHermitian to accept a general pair of indices
  {ia,ja,ka,...,ib,jb,kb...} where ia==replaceTags(ib,tags(ib),tags(ia)), etc.
o Generalize the convention of DMRG and applyMPO to accept MPOs with more general
  tag conventions, not just {s1,s2,...,s1',s2',...}
? Remove SiteSet from MPS class.
  o Matt: this would make it so that people can use MPS without SiteSet, if they
    want to do that, since SiteSet is a bit constrained and requires a lot of code
    to make an MPS on a set of sites that is not defined in ITensor.
    One can define siteIndex(psi,b) = uniqueIndex(psi.A(b),psi.A(b-1),psi.A(b+1))
    to get a site index, and siteInds(psi) to extract the sites as a siteset
    to make another MPS with the same sites.
  o Note that the MPO class could also have SiteSet removed, and the sites could
    be defined by siteInds(H,b) = uniqueInds(H.A(b),H.A(b-1),H.A(b+1)) -> IndexSet to allow MPOs
    with arbitrary Index conventions, i.e. {i1,i2,i3,...,j1,j2,j3,...}
    Then, siteInds(H,b) can be used for tracing, for example H.A(b)*delta(siteInds(H,b))
? PrintMatrix(ITensor,{Index,...},{Index,...}) function
  o Matt: the idea is to make a print function that doesn't just print the data of the ITensor
    as one big list, but instead print it in a grid that makes it look like a matrix. For example,
    for ITensor A with Index's i,j,k,l, PrintMatrix(A,{i,k},{l,j})
    prints A as if it were a matrix where the rows run over the combined Index (i,j) and
    the columns run over the combined index (l,j). I think this is especially useful
    for QN conserving ITensors, where it could make it easier to visualize
    blocks of the ITensor.
o Implement randomMPS(InitState,m>1)
? Add back some prime functions:
  o A.primeExcept(plinc=1,index1,index2,...)
  o A.primeExcept(plinc=1,tagset)
  o A.mapPrime(pold1,pnew1,index1,pold2,pnew2,index2,...)
? Add {"Randomize=",true} args for MPS(SiteSet)
  o Right now, just call randomMPS(siteset)
  o Matt: I prefer randomMPS(...) since it is consistent with randomITensor(...),
    though we could make ITensor(...) accept {"Randomize=",true} args
? Error for calls like Index(0,"i"), Index(QN(0),0,"j"), etc.
? Add some more tag functions
  o A.addTags(tagset,imatch1,imatch2,...)
? In site sets, make all of the indices have the same ids but different tags
