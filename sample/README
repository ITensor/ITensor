Compiling the Sample Codes
==============================================

To compile all of the sample codes, first compile
the ITensor library following the instructions on
the itensor.org website. Then inside of this folder,
issue the command

    make

to compile all of the sample codes.

To compile just one of the sample codes, such as
dmrg.cc, issue the command

    make dmrg

or more generally `make <codename>` to compile
the file <codename>.cc


Descriptions of the Codes
==============================================

dmrg - simple ground-state DMRG of spin chains

dmrgj1j2 - DMRG for the J1-J2 spin chain
           J2/J1 = 0.5 is the AKLT point with
           bond dimension 2 ground state

dmrg_table - DMRG sample code which takes an 
             external input file (inputfile_dmrg_table)

exthubbard - DMRG calculation for ground state of 
             extended Hubbard model 
             Uses inputfile_exthubbard for 
             input parameters

mixedspin - demo code showing how to make and use
            a site set with alternating S=1/2 and
            S=1 spins

trg - tensor renormalization group (TRG) algorithm
      for computing properties of large 2D classical
      stat mech systems

ctmrg - corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) algorithm
        for computing properties of large 2D classical
        stat mech systems
