Installation Instructions

### Building the Libraries

1. Download the boost library (http://www.boost.org). This is a free, high quality, open source C++ library used extensively by ITensor and
   potentially helpful for your own application development.

2. The ITensor library expects boost to be in a folder called "boost" located in the same directory as the ITensor library itself (one directory above this file). After unpacking the boost download, either move the "boost_#_##" folder to this location and rename it to "boost", or create a symlink using the command "ln -s location/of/boost_#_## boost".

[At this point, if you are installing onto a recent version of Mac OSX with the appropriate developer tools (such as XCode), simply type 'make' in the toplevel library directory to build. If you are on another platform, read on...]

3. Edit the toplevel Makefile in the same directory as this file. For instance, if you are using the Intel MKL library for your BLAS/LAPACK, uncomment the line "PLATFORM=intel", then edit the matrix/intel/Makefile.default file to reflect the location of MKL on your own system. 


### Linking your own applications to the libraries
