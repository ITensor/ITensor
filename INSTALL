### Building the Libraries

1. Download the boost library (http://www.boost.org). This is a free, high quality, open source C++ library 
   used extensively by ITensor and potentially helpful for your own application development.

2. Edit the user configurable options. Start by making a copy of the sample options file: 
   'cp options.mk.sample options.mk'. Then edit options.mk in your favorite text editor. 

   At a minimum, you must make sure that BOOST_DIR points to the location of your unpacked boost libraries 
   folder (the default is a folder called 'boost' located one directory above this file). Also, if you are 
   using a system other than a recent Mac, edit PLATFORM, BLAS_LAPACK_INCLUDEFLAGS and 
   BLAS_LAPACK_LIBFLAGS to reflect the type and location of your BLAS/LAPACK libraries.

3. Finally, at the top level of the library (same directory as this file), type "make". 
   If all goes well, the built library files should appear in the LIBDIR folder specified in options.mk.

### Building the sample and sandbox apps

We have provided sample applications under the 'sample' directory. Also, we have provided a 'sandbox' folder 
with some apps for you to modify to experiment with the library's features.

To build these apps, simply 'cd' into each folder and type 'make'. Or, to build an individual app
type 'make <appname>'.

### Linking your own applications to the libraries

### Troubleshooting

Sometimes the library has issues compiling if the make "-j" flag is used (this flag enables parallel 
compilation on multi-core machines). Try disabling it if you have compilation errors.
