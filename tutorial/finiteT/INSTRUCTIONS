Building the codes
--------------------

To compile the ancilla code: 
    make app=ancilla

To compile the METTS code: 
    make app=metts

Running the Codes
--------------------

Edit the files inputfile_ancilla
and inputfile_metts.

Then:
./ancilla inputfile_ancilla
./metts inputfile_metts

Coding Activity
-------------------

(1) Compile and run the ancilla
code. It will generate output files
"en.dat" and "sus.dat" giving
the energy density and susceptibility
as a function of 'coolness' beta.

(2) Search the file "metts.cc" for
lines labeled TODO (3 of these)

Add the missing definitions of 
the PUp projection matrix and
upState and downState vectors
to enable measurement in the X
basis.

Then change the "dir" variable
(near the end of main)
to switch from "Z" to "X" on
alternating even/odd steps.
